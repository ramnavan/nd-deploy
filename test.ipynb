You can combine code, markdown, images, videos, graphs, all in one format.\n\nBest of all this service is free to use. If you are:\n  * a teacher and need a hassle-free Python/R environment for classes\n  * giving a webinar and don't want attendees to spend 45 mins installing software\n  * dev or hobbyst and need a code scratchpad quickly\n  * a data scientist and need a full R, Python (Anaconda) environment\n\nWe think Azure Notebooks can empower you to accomplish your work and achieve more.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "---\n# Where can I find samples and interesting notebooks? <a id='intro_samples'><\/a>", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "We have a few curated samples for you to start on but there are also a few external sources of good samples.\n\nIf you are brand new to notebooks, the following notebooks are most interesting:\n\n* [The samples library on Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/library/samples) provides a great set of starter notebooks.\n\n* [Intro to Jupyter notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)\n* [Intro to Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/tree/master/code_listings) by Jake Vanderplas\n\n\nThere are thousands and thousands of fantastic notebooks for just about any field...\n\n* See the Sample notebooks on [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/#sample-redirect) front page\n* A [curated list of interesting Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "---\n# An overview of using Jupyter <a id='using_jupyter'><\/a>", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "Jupyter is a powerful execution environment based in your browser.

Most common sites are open, but if you experience an access denied on a web request, please request we open it by contacting us at nbhelp@microsoft.com.\n\n## Support for Azure Notebooks\n\n* Please send mail to: nbhelp@microsoft.com\n\n## Data sources\n\nThere is a lot of data available online - it depends what you want to do.  A couple of resources:\n\n* https://blog.bigml.com/list-of-public-data-sources-fit-for-machine-learning/\n* http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/#469939567961 \n\nNote that data must be accessible to the service - ideally on Github, Dropbox, OneDrive, Azure blobs, SQLAzure, ...\n\n## Azure Machine Learning\n\n* If you want to get deeper into ML, especially with R (using Microsoft's scalable R), try [Cortana Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/cortana-intelligence-suite), and [Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/).\n\n## IDEs for Python and R\n\nJupyter does not support rich debugging / profiling / etc. features of traditional IDE's.  You can always save your notebook file as code and import and debug it.  Some IDE's have indirect support for Jupyter as well.
